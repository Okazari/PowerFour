What is Powerfour ?
---

PowerFour is a connect 4 game made on stream along with viewers :)

What the heck is this name ?
---

I started to write this little app flowing my stream chat suggestions.
I didn't now the actual name of this type of game is "Connect 4" so i named it translating word to word from french.
That's where PowerFour come from.

What about the cupcakes ?

In french, "Four" stands for oven. So we decided to make this sweet logo for it based on it's name.

So the chat said: If this game title is PowerFour, the pieces should be cupcakes.

and here they are !

Anything else ?

Don't look at the code, i made it for fun on stream and it's pretty ugly ! I just wanted things to works.


If you have ideas on how to improve the game PR are welcome !
